I'm not sure if this will really be useful/used by anyone, but I'm
going to keep a version log.  Basically, if you use a version of the
denotation graph whose results you want to be able to reproduce, note
done in this file: what the results were used for, which revision
should be used to get those results, and the commands used to produce
the results.
