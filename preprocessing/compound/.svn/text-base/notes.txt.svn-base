scripts/run.sh NAME
Input: pretoken file (tokenizer output)
Output: token file (tokenized output)
These scripts handle four things: 
  1. They normalize a number of compound nouns and verbs,
  2. They clean up the output of the tokenizer.
  3. They fix a number of common spelling mistakes.
  4. They remove a number of characters that later scripts will have
     trouble with: [, ], /, and some spaces (leading, trailing, double)


data/nouns.txt
Contains compound nouns that should be one token.  Compound terms are
written with a space between words.  Only the singular form needs to
be written.  "bull dog" means that both "bull dog" and "bull-dog" will
be rewritten as "bulldog".  Also, it handles the "bull dogs" case as
well.

data/verbs.txt
Contains compound verbs that should be one token.  Compound terms are
written with a space between words, with the second word just being
the prefix.  For example, "break danc" matches "break dancing", "break
dances", "break-dance", etc.  The space or hyphen will be removed,
joining the two words.  This will also be likely to fix the "-er" and
"-ers" cases as well ("break dancers", etc.)

data/split.txt
Contains compound words that should be split up.  For example, "hard
hats" will turn instances of "hardhats" into "hard hats".  Unlike
"data/nouns.txt" and "data/verbs.txt", these are (ignoring case) exact
matches only.

data/hyphen.txt
Contains hyphenated terms that should be hyphenated.  For example,
"flip-flop" means that "flip flop" will be turned into "flip-flop".
Again, is an exact match (ignoring case), so make sure you
pluralize/conjugate if needed.


The following list of scripts are presented in the order
"scripts/run.sh" runs them.

scripts/fixPunct.pl
Fixes tokenization errors with punctuation.  Leading and trailing "
and , are tokenized, and ending periods are tokenized if the
non-period version of the last token has been seen before.  I.e.,
should tokenize "river." -> "river .", since we've seen "river", but
not "Dr.", because we probably haven't seen "Dr".

scripts/fixNouns.pl
Join together nouns in "data/noun.txt" if they show up separated by a
space or a hyphen.

scripts/fixVerbs.pl
Join together verbs in "data/verb.txt" if they show up separated by a
space or a hyphen.

scripts/fixAwomen.pl
Replace "women" and "men" with their singular forms when they show up
as "a women" or "a men", and are not part of "a women 's X" or "a men
's X".

scripts/fixSplit.pl
Split up compound terms in "data/split.txt".  Uses exact (although
case-ignoring) matches.

scripts/fixTshirt.pl
Replace "t/tee shirt/shirts" with "t-shirt(s)".

scripts/addHyphen.pl
Hyphenate compound terms in "data/hyphen.txt".

scripts/fixInFromOf.pl
"in from of" -> "in front of".

scripts/dropHyphen.pl
Turn "ice-cream" into "ice cream", and drop the hyphen in "-sail"
("wind-sail", etc.) and "-board" ("surf-board", etc.)

scripts/replaceBrackets.pl
Replace square brackets ('[' and ']') with parentheses ('(' and ')').

scripts/stripSlash.pl
Remove '/' from the captions - we will be using that as a separator
later on.  Print out a warning if any captions have a '/'.

scripts/fixWhitespace.pl
Remove leading, trailing, and double whitespaces.

scripts/checkHash.pl
Check for hashes that are part of another token.  This may be overly
conservative, but hashes in tokens ("#8") tend to give WordNet
problems.  Hashes by themselves ("#"), do not.  Fix them if you can,
the part of speech tagger will also get more of them fixed.
