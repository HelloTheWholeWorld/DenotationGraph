scripts/run.sh
Input: POS file
Output: coref file + NP file
This script runs further chunks entity mentions (building entity
mentions out of NPs, or NP of NPs, in specific cases).  It'll perform
entity co-reference, and create the coref file (which adds entity
mention chunks, some typing information to NP chunks, and entity
co-reference IDs) and the NP file (list of entity mentions in the
corpus).  See "../corpora/notes.txt" for a more detailed description.


scripts/runNoCoref.sh
Input: POS file
Output: coref file + NP file
As above, but it skips the entity co-reference step and inserts dummy
co-reference IDs instead.


scripts/getNPs.pl
Generates NP files from POS files.  Identifies the determiner,
modifier, and head of each NP chunk.  Does this by identifying known
determiners at the start of an NP chunk, using WordNet to identify the
head noun, and then treating the remainder of the NP chunk as the
modifier.  This script gets called several times, in order to
reproduce the NP file, after changes have been made to the POS file.

Uses the data files "data/notcnouns.txt" (a list of non-compound nouns
- i.e., "black cat" is actually a "cat", and not the WordNet entry for
"black cat"), and "data/synset-lexicon.txt" (a lexicon of some common
terms that have multiple synsets.  For example, "man" is "man#n#1").


The rest of the scripts are described in the order they are used.


scripts/fixNPs.pl

See "tmp/NAME/NP.log" for a log of what this script does.  For
example:

[NP An/DT athlete/JJ ] [VP leaping/VBG ]

The script rechunked "[NP An athlete leaping ]" into the above.  Check
the lines marked "CHECK" more carefully.

If there is a word in the noun part of WordNet in an NP chunk, break
up the NP chunk at that word, and then rechunking the remainder of the
NP chunk.


scripts/fixANNS.pl
As above, see "tmp/NAME/ANNS.log" for a log of what this script does.

If we have an NP that starts with "a" or "an" and ends with a plural
head noun, rechunk it.  Look for a good noun starting from the second
to last word in the NP chunk, and make that into a new NP chunk.


scripts/fixDef.pl
TODO

Replace definite articles with indefinite articles.

6. fixVerbing.pl - fix cases where the modifier ends on a VBG -
   usually turning the VBG into its own VP
   input: NP file, POS file
   output: POS file

7. getNPs.pl - use the updated chunks to create a new NP file

8. makeEntity.pl - check X of Y cases, and join them when its
   <container> of <liquid> or <group> of <people>
   input: NP file, POS file
   output: POS file

9. getNPs.pl - use the entity chunks to create a new NP file

10. easyCorefs.pl - do some basic coref (exact head match) and typing
    (body of water)
    input: NP file
    output: NP file

11. makeHypeLexicon.pl - generates the WordNet lexicon.  Important files
    are notperson.txt (synset terms that can not be people, even if the
    first synset in their entry is a person noun), and person.txt
    (synset terms that can be people, even if the first synset in their
    entry is a non-person noun.)
    input: NP file
    output: lexicon file

12. corefNPs.pl - deterministic coreference.
    input: NP file, lexicon file
    output: corefed NP file

13. makeCoref.pl - apply the coreferences to the POS file
    input: POS file, corefed NP file
    output: coref file

?. latticeCoref.pl - use corefed NP replacement to generate new
   sentences
   input: coref file
   output: coref file

For the determiners we only look at NPs that contain at least two
words.  We grab the first word as part of the determiner if it has a
POS tag of DT, PRP$, CD, LS (List Segment - usually a mis-tagged CD),
or is the word "same", "several", "many", "other", "multiple",
"various", "more", and "different" (different can sometimes be a good
idea "different teams" and sometimes less good of an idea "different
colored teams").  If the determiner is "a", "an", or "the", we add the
next word to the determiner if the NP is at least three words and the
next word is "few", "couple", "same", "other", or has the POS tag CD.
We could also use the POS tag LS, but they're very infrequent, and at
least half of them are not part of the determiner.

Singular indefinite article/plural head noun - look for a head noun
that is good (according to the above definition), and that is not
plural.  If the previous word is good and not a plural, and the old
head noun ends in -s and is not "outdoors" or "indoors", turn it into
a VBZ.  Also, make sure that the next thing is not an NP that starts
with a POS tag.  Also, change "a women" into "a woman".

We split determiner normalization into two tasks.  First is
determining if the head noun should be treated as a plural or
singular.  Singular head nouns will use "a" or "an", and plural head
nouns will use a blank.  We ignore the definite case for now.  We can
find the majority usage of the indefinite/blank case for each head
noun, and then use that for normalization.  In general, people may
drop the "a" or "an", and thus we need to re-add it.  However, if they
have added an "a" or an "an", we should be looking out for parser errors.


Breaking up sentences:

1. SBAR - identifie the subordinate clause nicely.

2. commas - tagger does not identify - see sentence 1991806812_065f747689.jpg#4

3. conjunctions - tagger does not completely identify - I'd say look
   for a conjunction that isn't part of another phrase, but the tagger
   has a tendency to break up NPs with conjunctions that way as well.
   See sentence 2113530024_5bc6a90e42.jpg#4

Adding an indefinite article:

1. Identify singular count nouns (i.e., nouns that would require the
   use of an indefinite article) by majority vote over the a/an versus
   empty article cases.  (This can be dangerous - ambiguous nouns -
   i.e., could use a definite or indefinite article will show up as
   singular count nouns based on this, since we ignore the definite
   case.  Hmm.)

2. Add the indefinite article if you are singular, and have no
   determiner at all.

Definite to indefinite on singular subjects.

1. Earlier in the sentence is better - less possibility that your
   existence is implied by something else in the sentence (i.e.,
   goal implies a single goalie).

2. You can use the if the definite article when context (either
   assumed, external, or as described by the sentence) implies there
   is only one of the entity that you could be referring to - i.e.,
   the sky, the sun, the ocean, the ground, the floor (but, a hardwood
   floor).  This can be tricky - "a couple" would let you refer to
   "the man" and "the woman", as presumably each are part of the
   couple.  A crowd/the crowd?  Unsure.

3. You can also use the definite article if you're referring to
   something you've previously mentioned or implied - again, this can
   be tricky, for example, describing the action going on in a game,
   can be suffixed with "while a crowd watches the game" - the
   existence of the game/match is implied.

4. Not quite proper nouns - entities that aren't unique by themselves,
   but have a description that makes them unique - "the number 52
   motorcycle", presumably only one motorcycle (at least as far as the
   context is concerned) is numbered 52.  Or "the red team".

exceptions - proposition - they all require some additional
description to make them unique.

The number 52 motorcyclist - there's probably only one number 52 motorcycle

The orange rider - may or may not be the same - depends on if the
riders are color coded, in which case, yes, it should stay definite,
but ... it's probably okay to turn it into an indefinite.

The mans shirt (missing possessive) - specific person/shirt in mind.

The red team - much more certain than the orange rider case - color
can be used to uniquely identify a team.

The opposing basketball player - I'm kind of okay with turning this
one indefinite.

The number 2 dog - as with number 52 motorcyclist

the green team, the red team - as the other team example.

The horses race - parsing error

[The racing dog] with the "4" jersey - I'm inclined to leave this as a
definite, but I can see it going either way.

the mountain landscape - not sure.

the ocean - not quite unique, but unique enough

a dirt bike ... as [the rider] - rider is presumed by bike.

a batter playing cricket missed [the ball] - single ball in play in cricket.

[the fall] leaves - parsing error

Both [the larger dog] and the smaller dog - contrasting

the bottom - presumably the top, the side, etc.  part of

A couple sits together while [the man] - distinctly identifies part of
the couple.

the sky - unique

the number "4" - unique

converge at the goal and [the goalie] - unique because of the goal

the batsman - unique?  maybe.

the baseman - as above

the crowd - probably only one crowd

the other X - distinct

A man and are playing cards but [the man] - distinct.  I think.

the catcher - unique position

the pitcher - unique position

the referee - could go either way, but I'm thinking of games with
multiple refs

the batter - temporarily unique position

the drummer - probably only one drummer in a band.  Ditto on the guitarist

A brown and black lab are outside and [the black lab] - previous reference

Two dogs walk in the snow, [the larger dog] - part of previous reference

A couple of people are standing and [the person] - part of previous reference

the game - presumably a distinct event

the show - as above

the lady in front - part of previous reference

A man and woman look to the right, [the man] - part of previous reference

Winnie [the Pool t-shirt] - parsing error.  Part of a name.

Two girls are both eating and [the girl] - part of previous reference

the third - distinct

the judge - as the referee

for a profession photograph while [the photographer] - presumably only one.

man on the left with his mouth open while [the man] on the right - distinct

[the band] "Kiss" - distinct entity

the camera - picture taker - distinct


Questions:

1. Does article drop cluster?  I.e., if someone article drops, do they
   do it everywhere in the caption?  Nope.  No such luck.


Head nouns that are always (or almost always roots):
Checking if the next word is also a possible head noun doesn't seem to help.

man
men
woman
boy
girl
person
dog (dog sled, dog sledding, dog owner, dog show, dog park, dog obedience)
shirt? (a lot of the time it's next to a conjunction)
hat (like shirt, a lot of the time it's next to a conjunction)
jacket (see above)
dress (except for dress shirt)
coat (see above)
shorts
sweatshirt
t-shirt
helmet
outfit
grass

Checking conjunctions - how to?

1. getNPs.pl - get the entities.
   input: POS file
   output NP file

2. fixPPNP.pl - this normalize the determiner of the phrase: "through
   the/a/an X" (with no succeeding PP - i.e., so not "through the X of
   Y"), using the majority for each head noun.  Yeah, not sure why
   limiting it to through was necessary.
   input: NP file, POS file
   output: POS file
